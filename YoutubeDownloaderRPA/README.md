# YoutubeDownloaderRPA
Youtube downloader RPA (Robotic Process Automation) Using UIPath

Currently, there are many sites that allows you to download the youtube videos into any formats to your PC for offline consumption, but I can't seem to find any sites that can download multiple videos by providing a list of links.
This script will allow you to do that by providing a list in CSV format and the RPA will do the rest.

# Requirements
Install the UIPath Community Edition from here https://www.uipath.com

# Usage
1. Install UIPath Community Edition.
2. Make a CSV file that contains a list of youtube video links that you want to download.
3. Open YoutubeDownloaderRPA project/script in UIPath.
4. Click the Run button in UIPath
5. The script will ask for the CSV files to be processed. Just select the CSV file you just created.
6. The RPA will open a browser and download the youtube videos. It will ask you to press the OK button once the file has been downloaded so that it can continue to the next youtube link.
7. Enjoy.
